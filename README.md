# PromptCalc

PromptCalc is a spec-driven prototype for turning prompts into constrained, offline calculator UIs. The canonical specification lives in [`spec/SPEC.md`](spec/SPEC.md) and is the single source of truth.

## Prototype steps (high level)
- Step 0: Spec lock and policy artifacts.
- Step 1: Scaffold inputs/outputs for the prototype pipeline.
- Step 2: Renderer wiring for calculator UI.
- Step 3: Safe evaluation pipeline.
- Step 4: Scanner and enforcement integration.
- Step 5: End-to-end prototype validation.
